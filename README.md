## Summary: 
In summary, I think there a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program based on the percentage, Vine reviewers provide 5-star reviews more than the non-Vine reviewers. In addition, another analysis can be used to support the earlier such as performing statistical analysis to further determine and understand the difference in reviews between Vine reviewers and non-vine reviewers.
